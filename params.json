{"name":"Html Debugger","body":"# Welcome #\r\n\r\nIeMobileDebugger is a simple IE debug tool for Windows Phone.\r\n\r\n### Background ###\r\n\r\nWorking very close with the numerous mobile web frameworks I see how often people (mostly developers) complain about the lack of the tool to debug html produced by a Windows Phone Browser. This also means that there is no way to share the page structure to get help or to just debug the page in more comfortable environment.\r\nI agree that most of the things could be debugged in IE9 desktop because IE9Mobile is very similar to IE desktop. But they are NOT EQUAL, and I saw many cases where they worked differently and I personally ran into IE9Mobile specific issues many times. So having such a tool will be a huge developer aid IMHO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is my proof-of-concept (\"prototype-level\") implementation of such Windows Phone IE debug tool based on PhoneGap (now Cordova) framework. \r\n\r\n### Functionality ###\r\n\r\n The tool provides VERY SIMPLE implementation of the key html debug functionality: \r\n * getting html layout source;\r\n * access to debug console output; \r\n * access to dom information. \r\n \r\n### Try it ###\r\nTODO link to Marketplace\r\n\r\n### Copyrights ###\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n  \r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.","tagline":"Simple IE debug tool for Windows Phone","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
