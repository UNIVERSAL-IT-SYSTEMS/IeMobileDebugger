### Background ###

Working very close with the numerous mobile web frameworks I see how often people (mostly developers) complain about the lack of the tool to debug html produced by a Windows Phone Browser. This also means that there is no way to share the page structure to get help or to just debug the page in more comfortable environment.
I agree that most of the things could be debugged in IE9 desktop because IE9Mobile is very similar to IE desktop. But they are NOT EQUAL, and I saw many cases where they worked differently and I personally ran into IE9Mobile specific issues many times. So having such a tool will be a huge developer aid IMHO.


This project is my proof-of-concept ("prototype-level") implementation of such Windows Phone IE debug tool based on PhoneGap (now Cordova) framework. 

### Functionality ###

 The tool provides VERY SIMPLE implementation of the key html debug functionality: 
 * getting html layout source;
 * access to debug console output; 
 * access to dom information.
